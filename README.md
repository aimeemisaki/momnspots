## 👩‍💻 User stories

- As a citizen and user, I would like an application that brings attention to Mom n Pop shops and citizens' stories/memories with those shops that make them special so that those Mom n Pop shops can continue and thrive in their businesses and citizens can have a sense of unity in shared memories - revingorating a sense of community post-COVID.
- As a member of my local community and the online community, I want to use an app that integrates tech and in-person societal foundations, so that I can see tech in a multi-disciplinary way and envision a world where both can be supported.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my own posts, so I can update my posts for any reason (eg. a store has closed).
- As a user, I would like to be able to see all Mom n Pop shops posted by other users so that I can browse shops and come across Mom n Pop shops to support by random.
- As a user, I would like to sign up and create an account, so I can post a Mom n Pop shop story that has meaning to me from my account.
- As a user,  I would like to see every post have 1) at least one image of the shop or what they're famous for, 2) the name of the shop, 3) the neighborhood where the shop is located in, 4) the poster's story/description, so that I can know the details of the shop and decided whether or not to go based on those details.

### 💪 Challenges
Learning Django within 3 days and creating a full-stack application in one software platform meant reading up on many docs and searching errors I had never seen before. Deployment on Heroku from Django was also most definitely a challenge, with error logs not being too specific; for example, there was a time where nothing was wrong with my code, but I was receieving an application error, so I ended up just creating a new heroku app and connected it to my existing repo and it worked! Furthermore, I challenged myself further by putting more effort into styling than usual, because I understand that an aesthetically appealing app is, of course, integral for users - now that was a challenge, especially using Bulma, a new styling framework I had never used before.
